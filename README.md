With the advent of vast biological data sets biological and medical studies are increasingly relying on computational methods to extract knowledge from the data. Creating correlation-network is one of the methods of reducing the complex data into potential co-occurence of species or microorganisms. This repositor has the codes used in the following paper.

Jody J. Wright, Kishori M. Konwar and Steven J. Hallam. Microbial ecology of expanding oxygen minimum zones, Nature Reviews Microbiology 10, 381-394 (June 2012).

This repository contains two scripts:

1. compute_centrality.py : This computes the centrality of a correlation network

2. enterotypes_graph.pl : This script generates the correlation network from a QIIME OTU table
